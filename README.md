# Linear Regression Assignment
There is a business called Boom Bikes sharing where bikes are available on sharing basis to the customers for a certain period of time. They have seen a decline in their business due to some reasons. They have collected data from the past and they want it to be analysed for key factors which are affecting their business. So that they can build an efficient business model using them.
